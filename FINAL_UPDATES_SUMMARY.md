## Overview
Successfully completed 6 critical fixes and enhancements requested by the user, transforming the application into a production-ready system with accurate calculations, improved reporting, and granular permission controls.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Inventory Reports - Consolidated with Values

**Problem:** Products shown in multiple rows (one per location), no value calculations

**Solution:**
- **Grouped by Product:** All three inventory reports now consolidate same products into single rows
- **Added Value Columns:**
  - Unit Cost (weighted average from all purchases)
  - Total Value (Quantity × Unit Cost)
- **Summary Rows:** Each report shows "Total Inventory Value" at the bottom
- **Helper Function:** Created `calculateAverageUnitCost()` for accurate unit cost calculations

**Reports Updated:**
- Total Inventory Report
- Warehouse Inventory Report
- Customer Inventory Report

**Example:**
```
Before:
Product A | Warehouse 1 | 50
Product A | Warehouse 2 | 30
Product A | Warehouse 3 | 20

After:
Product A | 100 | ₹50.00 | ₹5,000.00
────────────────────────────────────
Total Inventory Value: ₹5,000.00
```

### 2. ✅ Rental Value Calculation - Fixed Day Count

**Problem:** Rental calculations adding +1 day incorrectly

**Solution:**
- **Removed +1:** Changed `Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)) + 1` to `Math.ceil(diffTime / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24))`
- **Accurate Period:** Now correctly calculates days between start and end dates
- **Monthly Summary:** Updated to consider actual rental start dates within the current month

**Impact:**
- Customers no longer overcharged by 1 day
- Monthly rental estimates accurate
- Detailed rental reports show correct day counts

**Example:**
```
Before (Incorrect):
Start: Jan 1, End: Jan 3
Days = 2 + 1 = 3 days (overcharging)

After (Correct):
Start: Jan 1, End: Jan 3
Days = 2 days (accurate)
```

### 3. ✅ Dashboard Inventory Value - Fixed Calculation

**Problem:** Warehouse inventory value showing negative numbers

**Root Cause:** Incorrect calculation logic: `warehouseValue = totalPurchases - customerValue`

**Solution:**
- **Used `useInventory` Hook:** Now uses actual stock levels from the inventory tracking system
- **Proper Logic:**
  ```
  Warehouse Value = Σ(warehouse stock quantity × average unit cost)
  Customer Value = Σ(customer stock quantity × average unit cost)
  Total Value = Warehouse Value + Customer Value
  ```
- **Accurate Tracking:** Accounts for all transactions: purchases, transfers, returns, sales

**Result:** Dashboard now shows correct, positive values for warehouse inventory

---

### 4. ✅ Removed Active Rentals from Dashboard

**Problem:** Active Rentals metric not needed

**Solution:**
- Completely removed "Active Rentals" card from Dashboard
- Dashboard now shows only essential metrics:
  - Pending Rental Orders
  - Est. Current Month Rental
  - Total Overall Inventory Value
  - Inventory Value with Customers
  - Inventory Value at Warehouse

**Benefit:** Cleaner, more focused dashboard with essential business metrics only

---

### 5. ✅ Force Close for Rental Orders

**Problem:** No way to close partially fulfilled orders

**Solution:**
- **New Status:** Added "Part Fulfilled & Closed" status
- **Force Close Button:**
  - Shows only for Partially Fulfilled orders
  - Positioned between Edit and Delete
  - Requires confirmation
- **Status Display:** Blue tag for "Part Fulfilled & Closed" orders
- **Workflow:**
  1. Order partially delivered
  2. Admin decides to close it
  3. Clicks "Force Close"
  4. Confirms action
  5. Order marked as "Part Fulfilled & Closed"

**Use Case:** When customer no longer needs remaining items, admin can close the order without full delivery

---

### 6. ✅ Module-wise Permissions System

**Problem:** Limited permission control (only role-based: admin/user/viewer)

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive, granular permission system

#### New Permission Structure:

**4 Permission Levels per Module:**
- VIEW - Can view the module
- CREATE - Can create new records
- EDIT - Can edit existing records
- DELETE - Can delete records

**11 Modules:**
1. Dashboard
2. Products
3. Warehouses
4. Customers
5. Purchases
6. Transfers
7. Returns
8. Sales
9. Rental Orders
10. Reports
11. Settings

#### Implementation Details:

**1. New Files Created:**
- `src/constants/permissions.js` - Defines modules, permissions, and default role permissions
- `src/hooks/usePermissions.js` - Custom hook for permission checks

**2. Default Role Permissions:**
```javascript
Admin: Full access to all modules (View, Create, Edit, Delete)
User: View + Create access (no Edit/Delete except on own records)
Viewer: View-only access to Dashboard, Products, Warehouses, Customers, Reports
```

**3. Custom Permissions:**
- Admins can override default permissions for individual users
- Managed through Settings > User Management > "Manage Permissions" button
- Table-based interface with checkboxes for each module/permission combination

**4. UI Integration:**
All pages updated to use permissions:
```javascript
// Before
{userRole === 'admin' && <Button>Edit</Button>}

// After
{canEdit(MODULES.PRODUCTS) && <Button>Edit</Button>}
```

**5. Menu Filtering:**
App.jsx menu dynamically filtered based on user's view permissions - users only see menu items they can access

**6. Database Structure:**
```javascript
users/{userId} {
  email: "user@example.com",
  role: "user",
  customPermissions: {
    products: ["view", "create", "edit"],
    warehouses: ["view", "create"],
    // ... etc
  }
}
```
